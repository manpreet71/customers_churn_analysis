# customers_churn_analysis
# In this project, I've used Python and it's libraries for **exploratory data analysis(EDA)** and uses libraries of python like **matplotlib** and **pandas** for **data visualisation**. I also prepare a detailed report along with summary and recommendations.
# By performing data analysis on such data, I figured out that there are **3 main reasons** for the which leads to the customer churn out.
# firstly the customers with **shorter tenure (less than one year or two)** are more likely to churn indicating criticality of initial engagement strategies.![Screenshot 2024-09-30 230103](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/306baa8c-83cf-4381-80be-1551f926575c)
# secondly, customers on month to month contract are more likely to churn than those on yearly and bi-yearly contracts. this suggests that long term contracts may improve customer retention.![Screenshot 2024-09-30 230130](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/35de29de-06cb-4963-823a-34513cb05dc9)
# Lastly, a significan proportion of customers using electronic checks are more likely to churn compared to those using other payment methods. This could be due to convenience or trust issues associated with electronic check payments.![Screenshot 2024-09-30 230201](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b9c50bc4-e732-4baf-b8cf-9afecfba9c84)
